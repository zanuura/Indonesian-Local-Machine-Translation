# Indonesian Local Machine Translation

This is experimental project to build Machine Translation for Indonesian Local Languages.

Indonesia has around 17,000 islands with 360 ethnic groups and around 840 regional languages. With so many tribes and languages, it makes communication and socialization difficult for us. That's why we created this translation machine in the hope that it can be a solution for our daily communication and socialization.

This project uses datasets from Nusax and CC100 and uses pretrained models from Transformers. The NusaX dataset itself has 12 languages ​​that have been labeled, namely Indonesian, English, and 10 Indonesian local languages, namely Acehnese, Balinese, Banjarese, Buginese, Madurese, Minangkabau, Javanese, Ngaju, Sundanese, and Toba Batak. And the CC100 dataset has around 100 languages, but we only use the sub-dataset, namely Javanese and Sundanese, because currently we are still focusing on translation from Sundanese to Javanese and vice versa.
